This repository includes three files. This is my first attempt
at using selenium and Python to create a scraping project to
scrape data from seek.com.au.

 I first hard coded my script meaning
if I wanted to scrape a different job title I'd have to change the code,
however, then I decided to create a function so this could be repeated more
easily.
